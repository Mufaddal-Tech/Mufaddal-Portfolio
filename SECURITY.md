# Security Policy for Mufaddal's Portfolio

## Reporting a Vulnerability

I take the security of my personal portfolio website and underlying code seriously. I appreciate the efforts of security researchers and the community to responsibly disclose vulnerabilities.

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in **Mufaddal's Personal Portfolio** (or its source code), please report it to me as quickly as possible.

### Preferred Method for Reporting

Please send a detailed email directly to my dedicated contact address:

**Email Address:** `mufaddal.techpro@gmail.com`

**Note:** Please do not report security issues via public GitHub issues, general support comments, or social media to ensure a private and secure communication channel.

### What to Include in the Report

To help me triage and resolve the issue quickly, please include the following in your report:

* **Vulnerability Description:** A brief but detailed description of the vulnerability (e.g., XSS, broken access control, etc.).
* **Affected Component:** The specific page, file, or component of the portfolio that is affected.
* **Steps to Reproduce:** Clear, step-by-step instructions or a proof-of-concept (PoC) to demonstrate the vulnerability.
* **Impact:** Describe the potential impact of the vulnerability.

## My Security Commitment

I am committed to the following:

* **Confidentiality:** I will treat your report with strict confidentiality.
* **Timeliness:** I aim to acknowledge receipt of your report within **48 hours** and provide a status update on the remediation process.
* **Cooperation:** I will work with you to understand the issue and ensure a fix is implemented promptly.

## Disclosure Policy

Once a fix is available, I will update the code and publicly acknowledge your contribution (with your permission, of course) for the responsible disclosure.

I kindly request that you **do not** publicly disclose the vulnerability until I have had a reasonable amount of time to review and apply a patch.
